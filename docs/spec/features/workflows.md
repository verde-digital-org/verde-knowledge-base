# Custom Workflows

Custom Workflows in VERDE DIGITAL are designed to provide flexibility and control over document management processes, particularly for SFDR disclosure documents and other financial reporting needs. This feature allows organizations to create tailored sequences of tasks and approvals, adapting to specific operational and regulatory requirements.

The customizability ensures that each document is reviewed and sanctioned by the right personnel, maintaining the integrity and compliance of the process. Organizations can define their unique workflow stages, including draft, review, legal check, compliance approval, and final publication. Each stage can be assigned to specific roles within the organization, ensuring that only authorized individuals can make changes or approve the content.
Moreover, the workflow can be configured to trigger notifications to the relevant parties at each stage, enhancing communication and efficiency. This feature is particularly vital for ensuring adherence to complex regulations and internal policies. It supports real-time collaboration, allowing multiple users to work on a document simultaneously, with changes tracked and audited for transparency. 

In summary, Custom Workflows in VERDE DIGITAL are a powerful tool for financial institutions seeking to streamline their document management process, enhance operational efficiency, ensure regulatory compliance, and maintain high governance standards.
