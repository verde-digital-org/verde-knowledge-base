# Principal Adverse Impact (PAI)

The Principal Adverse Impact (PAI) indicators are a set of metrics that financial market participants use to assess and disclose the negative impacts of their investment decisions on sustainability factors. These factors typically include environmental, social, and employee matters, respect for human rights, anti-corruption, and anti-bribery aspects. PAI indicators are crucial for understanding the broader effects of investment activities and informing stakeholders about the sustainability risks associated with different investments. The implementation of PAI is in line with the broader goal of promoting sustainable investment and ensuring transparency in investment-related sustainability impacts.
