# Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR)

The Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) is a European Union regulation that aims to enhance transparency in the sustainability sector. It requires financial market participants to disclose information on sustainability risks, their impacts on investments, and how these investments affect environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors. The SFDR is crucial for maintaining compliance with EU regulations, ensuring transparency in sustainability practices, and fostering trust among investors. This regulation signifies the EU's commitment to integrating sustainability considerations into financial and investment decisions, thereby promoting more sustainable investment choices.
