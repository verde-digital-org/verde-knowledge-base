# European ESG Template (EET)

The European ESG Template (EET) is a standardized reporting format designed to facilitate the disclosure of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) information related to financial products. It aims to enhance transparency in the sustainable finance market by providing a clear and consistent framework for reporting ESG factors. The EET helps in simplifying the complex process of ESG data collection and reporting, making it easier for investors to compare and assess different financial products based on their ESG performance and impact. This standardized approach is crucial in promoting sustainable investment practices and enabling informed decision-making in the financial sector.
