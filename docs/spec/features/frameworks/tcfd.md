# Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)

The Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) provides a framework for companies to disclose climate-related financial risks and opportunities. Established by the Financial Stability Board, TCFD aims to develop consistent climate-related financial risk disclosures, enabling stakeholders to make well-informed decisions. The framework focuses on governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets. These disclosures help businesses understand and manage climate impacts on their operations, fostering greater transparency in how companies adapt and contribute to climate change mitigation.
